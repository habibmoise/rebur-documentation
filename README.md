# Rebur

YouTube performance documentation for creator agencies.

## What We Do

Preserve quarterly snapshots of YouTube channel performance 
for creator agencies managing talent portfolios.

## Why This Matters

When creators leave agencies, they revoke YouTube Analytics 
access. Agencies lose historical performance records needed 
for contract disputes, investor audits, and compliance.

## What We Preserve

- Channel subscriber counts
- Video view counts  
- Publication dates
- Video titles and descriptions

All data sourced from publicly visible YouTube metrics.

## Use Cases

- Contract dispute resolution
- Investor due diligence
- Regulatory compliance
- Portfolio performance documentation
